However, the team came up to an agreement to have a standard view when it comes to desktops and a standard view when it comes to mobile devices (having a burger icon for the menu).

But enough terminologies, the main reason for this decision was to try it out and see how it differs from different approaches. Although, the team liked working with this method, it took a lot of time designing each of the small elements (atoms) and figuring out how they work together. That was the main challenge. However, after we did all of the hard lifting, it was great for reusability and saved us a lot of time in the coding section.",

We separated the content in different categories which had different sorts of information such as band, stages, time and date information etc. Similarly to the Atomic Design. After we had built the structure it was easy to add new content on demand and that is what we were going with.",

I strive to have this feature on all of the projects I work upon as it gives me plenty of experience working with different media queries. For Svalegaarden Mest, it was not only a requirement but a chance for us to try and improve their existing responsive layout. The first thing we changed was the navigation and the way it functioned. After a team discussion, we went with the classic approach of having key words as navigational items for the menu on desktop versions. As for mobile devices, we went with a burger icon solution. A note to take here is that we decided to leave the classic view for Tablet devices as well. We thought that it gave it a unique view and blended well with the style we were going with.",

Of course, we had to go through several iterations after user tests, but in the end the team was happy with the information architecture and we went ahead and implemented it.

What we were trying to get out of it was which elements work and which elements do not work. We were basing this off of user tests after gaining enough information. We had reviewed several competitors of which, three in depth and took certain design patterns from them. Again, this was not a simple task to achieve so a lot of time was spent on research and user tests to make sure that the patterns we have chosen are appropriate for the project. The main challenge was the analysis of the research, but we took our time and managed to produce a valid framework and layout.",

/*Notes:

Line 220: A square braket is missing. At first contextData was an array, however, it appeared that I could not get access to setOne through Three if it was an
array so I removed the square brakets (so that it is no longer an array) and it worked out.
Line 172: Same
Line 124: Same

The idea behind projBrief and projContent (and this set of data as a whole) was to have the option to customize the text (have different colors and styles)

One drawback to the design... I need 3 images supporting each keyFeature at all times :/
